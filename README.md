# Data-Analytics-Project-3
For this project, the objective was to analyze house data from Washington, D.C. to compare the stats model and SKLearn.

Analysis for Stats Model

Ideally an investor would be interested in residential houses (not condos) in the NW quadrant. Since "actual year built" has a negative coefficient and "last year an improvement was built" has a positive coefficient based on this model, an older house with more recent constructruction would sell for a higher price. Additionally, a bigger house based on the gross building area in square feet should also sell for a higher price.

Analysis for SKLearn

Using the statsmodel, the adjusted R squared value was 0.905. Here the factors for the price vs. the predicted price using sklearn appear to have a very accurate model, since the MSE is equal to 1.
